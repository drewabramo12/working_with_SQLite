## Overview of Analysis

This project used sqlalchemy and SQLite to determine the statistical data about what temperature patterns could be expected for the months of June and December. These values will be helpful in determining if ice cream will be desirable in hawaii in months that are considered peak temperature(June) and lowest temperature(December).

## Results

The data shows that:

- June and December have standard deviations of 3.257417 and 3.745920 degrees respectively. While these values varie by half a degree, they do have relative consistence in temperature spread.

- June and December have average values of 74.94 and 71.10 degrees respectively. This shows that December's temperature stays relatively consistent as compared to June with only a 4 degree variation.

- The maximum degrees are relatively high at 85 for June and 83 for December. The minimum degrees do vary significantly with 64 degrees for June and 56 degrees for December.
